# Vibrate
This app is used to make the phone to vibrate.

The apk is the file Vibate.apk
Included are all the source packages.


/*** DISCLAIMER ***/
This app purely depends on the hardware of your phone. We can never assure it works on all devices. And more importantly depends on the surface where the phone is placed. Requires a smooth surface with no bumps. This is because the phone's vibration is a weak force and we are tapping into it. So surface should be preferabally glass or mosaic.
/******************/

Design::
The main screen of the app contains 2 buttons - 1.start cam 2.stop cam
The start cam option begins the vibration of the device and opens the device camera as well.
The stop cam button stops the vibration of the device.

Steps to Use the app::
1. Install the app on your phone.
2. Click the start camera option. 
3. The phone starts vibrating and camera opens.
4. Choose your desired option of Panorama or Video(Video not recommended because the vibration sound will also be recorded).
The following steps are only if your phone doesn't balance on its own if you place it upright on a flat surface.
5. Now take your charger and place it on a flat surface.(make sure that your charger isn't the type with the usb cable attached to it).
/*** ***/
important steps: Make sure you hold onto your phone while you do the steps. Any damage incurred by accidental dropping of the phone is not our fault
/*******/
6. Place your phone inbetween the pins of the charger such that it is balanced. 
7. Make sure that your phone is indeed balanced.
8. When you let go of your phone the charger should start to rotate.
9. If it doesn't rotate try making small adjustments to the position of the phone and see if it rotates.
10. If it still doesn't try changing the surface on which the charger is placed.
11. If it still doesn't rotate the phone is not compatible. There is valid reason for this which is quoted in the below section.

12. Once the desired panorama is captured save the image and press the back button.
13. Now Stop Camera to stop the vibration.
14. You can view the panorama captured.

Concepts used::
The Phone's vibration ringer is produced by an electric motor rotating an eccentric cam. Both the eccentric cam and the electric motor's armature both act as a spinning top whose rotation axis points horizontally in the `standing' Phone. With the spin axis horizontal, the force of gravity acting on the Center of Mass of the iPhone yields a torque being applied to the axle of the spinning cam. This torque causes the axis of rotation to precess producing the rotary motion of the Phone when ``standing'' on its end.

Why certain phones dont Rotate::

Certain phones employ a vibration ringer that moves a mass along a line instead of in a circle.Sice the vibration ringer is not spinning a mass, there is no gyroscopic precessional motion associated with this ringer. Hence there cannot be any spinning of the phone when it vibrates in an upright ``standing'' position.

Therefore the type of vibration present in the phone determines if it will rotate or not
